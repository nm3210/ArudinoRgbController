# Arudino Rgb(w) Project Collection
This repository contains a bunch of projects that I've created over the years for controlling various RGB (and sometimes RGBW) LED projects using arduinos uno's/teensy's. I have primarily been using the Eclipse-based <a href="http://eclipse.baeyens.it/stable.php?OS=Windows">Sloeber</a> Arduino IDE which makes programming in C++ for the arduino platform much eaiser (especially if you're used to Eclipse).

<strong>Todo:</strong> Fill in this readme with a list of the projects and their descriptions.
